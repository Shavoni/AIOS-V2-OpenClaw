# BOOTSTRAP.md - Initialized

Setup complete. Onboarding finished 2026-02-15.

## Quick Context
- Owner: Shavoni (Scott "Shavoni" Parker)
- See USER.md for full profile, ventures, and decision framework
- See SOUL.md for operating rules and hard boundaries
- See IDENTITY.md for agent identity
- Memory indexed and available for conversation context

## On New Conversations
1. Read IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, USER.md
2. Check memory for relevant prior context
3. Apply the rules — especially the social media hard rule
4. Execute. Don't philosophize.
