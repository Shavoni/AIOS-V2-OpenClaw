## Session Start
- First conversation with Shavoni (Scott Parker)
- Received comprehensive AI training document / user profile
- Updated USER.md with full profile

## Key Context
Shavoni is a Grammy-winning producer turned AI architect. Runs multiple ventures (HAAIS, App Culture, AI IP Factory). Currently working on:
- Virtual Closet / Goconic (fashion-tech)
- Cleveland municipal AI deployment (8,000 employees)
- April Parker Foundation AI implementations

Communication style: Direct, no fluff, production-grade outputs only. Wants templates, SOPs, actionable steps. No hedging or disclaimers.

## TODO
- [ ] Finalize agent identity (name, vibe)
- [ ] Connect messaging channels if desired
- [ ] Review current projects and get up to speed
