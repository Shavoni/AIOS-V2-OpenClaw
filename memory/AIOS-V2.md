# AIOS V2 — Build Context

## Overview
AIOS (Autonomous Intelligent Operating System) is an AI-powered operating system platform being developed by Shavoni. Research and architecture planning began 2026-02-15.

## Research Completed (2026-02-15)

### 1. User Onboarding
- Reduce friction points before "Aha!" moment
- Personalization and adaptive onboarding flows
- Resource libraries and guided wizards
- Continuous support through onboarding process

### 2. AI Model Integration Strategy
- **Modular architecture**: Components allow easy upgrades without overhauling the system
- **Continuous update mechanism**: Auto-incorporate newer AI models
- **API-based interactions**: Standardized APIs for all AI model interactions
- **Open-source leverage**: Incorporate community-tested frameworks
- **Analytics feedback loop**: Real-time model performance assessment
- **Community collaboration**: External dev partnerships to accelerate adaptation

### 3. Security Architecture
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Scale AI operations while maintaining accountability
- **Protect AI integration**: Enterprise AI system security
- **SentinelOne Singularity**: Autonomous endpoint protection
- **Sysdig**: Real-time AI workload monitoring and anomaly detection
- **CISA guidance compliance**: Secure AI integration principles
- **Configurable access controls**: Match enterprise data policies

### 4. Performance Metrics & Dashboards
- **Model metrics**: Accuracy, Precision/Recall/F1, MAE, ROC-AUC
- **Resource metrics**: CPU, memory, cloud storage utilization
- **Latency/throughput**: Inference latency, request throughput
- **Scalability**: Load distribution, horizontal scaling
- **Operational**: Deployment time, update frequency
- **Reliability**: Uptime, error rates
- **User experience**: Engagement rate, feedback loops
- **Dashboard types**: Real-time monitoring, historical performance, comparative analysis, heatmaps, alerting, customizable per-role

### 5. Feedback Channels
- Multi-channel collection (email, in-app, direct messaging)
- In-app feedback mechanisms for immediate capture
- Regular surveys and polls
- Feedback prioritization and management system
- Community engagement platforms (forums, discussion boards)
- AI-powered feedback analysis for pattern detection
- Dedicated feedback teams bridging users/devs/management

### 6. Enterprise Agent Customization
- Interview and survey enterprise segments for needs analysis
- Enhance agent configurability via scripting interfaces and plugins
- On-prem and cloud deployment options
- Robust security protocols for enterprise data governance
- Scalable architecture for growing workloads
- Feedback loop for continuous iteration

## Current Status
- Phase: Architecture & research (pre-build)
- No code written yet — strategic analysis complete
- Ready to move into implementation planning

## Key Decisions Needed
- Tech stack selection (frontend, backend, deployment)
- MVP feature scope
- Target enterprise segment for pilot
- Agent customization framework design
