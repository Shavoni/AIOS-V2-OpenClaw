# AIOS V2 - Build Plan

## Overview
Autonomous Intelligent Operating System V2 is designed to enhance modularity, security, and performance while providing unparalleled customization for enterprise environments.

## Key Components
1. **User Onboarding**
   - Objectives: Reduce friction, implement personalization, enhance adaptive flows, and provide comprehensive resource guides.
2. **AI Model Integration Strategies**
   - Objectives: Utilize modular architecture, enable continuous update mechanisms, leverage open-source models, and streamline API-based interactions.
3. **Advanced Security**
   - Objectives: Implement robust RBAC structures, secure integrations with Protect AI, Sysdig, SentinelOne, and ensure full compliance.
4. **Performance Metrics & Dashboards**
   - Objectives: Track model accuracy, resource utilization, and latency/throughput in real-time while utilizing heatmaps and alerting.
5. **Feedback Channels**
   - Objectives: Facilitate multi-channel feedback collection, integrate in-app mechanisms, analyze feedback with AI, and engage community participation.
6. **Enterprise Agent Customization**
   - Objectives: Enhance configurability for diverse enterprise environments, support scripting interfaces, and offer scalable on-prem vs cloud deployment options.
